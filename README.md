# 🧪 JS LocalStorage Playground

JS LocalStorage Playground is a small JavaScript demo that shows how
browser localStorage works using simple user input.

It is designed for beginners who want to understand
client-side storage behavior.

## What This Script Demonstrates

- Setting values in localStorage
- Reading values from localStorage
- Removing specific keys
- Clearing all stored data
- Using conditions with stored keys

## Why This Is Useful

localStorage is commonly used for:
